# Homer Multitext · HTML CTS Kit #

## Overview ##

This is a tool intended to be used with the [CITE Architecture](http://www.homermultitext.org/hmt-doc/cite/index.html "CITE Documentation"), the digital library architecture developed for the [Homer Multitext](http://www.homermultitext.org/ "Homer Multitext"). CITE includes the [Canonical Text Services Protocol](http://www.homermultitext.org/hmt-doc/cite/texts/cts.html "CTS"), for discovery and retrieval of canonically cited text through a networked digital library service.

## CTS URNs ##

CTS URNs are described [here](http://www.homermultitext.org/hmt-doc/cite/cts-urn-overview.html "CTS URNs"). 

## This Kit ##

This kit includes sample `html`, `javascript`, `css`, and `xslt` files that allow automatic resolution of CTS URNs to quotations of text. The author need only insert a URN into a `&lt;blockquote&gt;` element, and the Javascript will perform an `AJAX` function to resolve the URN to the text it points to.

## Using the HTML CTS Kit ##

Instructions for using the kit are included in the `index.html` page.CT Instructions").
